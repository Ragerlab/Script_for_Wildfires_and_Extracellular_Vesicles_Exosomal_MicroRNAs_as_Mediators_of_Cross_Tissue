This analysis set out to uncover significantly differentially expressed genes from mRNA count data of mouse heart and lung tissue that were exposed to a variety of wildfire smoke treatments. Burn conditions were flame or smolder for Peat, Red Oak, Saline, Pine, or Eucalyptus for either 4 hours or 24 hours. Appropriate contrasts were specified using the saline treatments as controls. Additionally, the analysis attempted to examine and account for potential variation in treatment groups through a follow-up experiment on the same data, but with the inclusion of one factor of variation calculated using the RUVSeq package.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72747901/175363625-a0085fc5-c6cc-4f13-bc6e-230cf2d30102.png)
